#add instructions on how to play the game and a description of the game

introduction=("Hello player/s, welcome to the game 'Imposter Amongst the Castle'. You will be detectives, if there are less than 4 players, than you will be playing with NPCs. In total, there are 4 main detectives, Anabel, Juliet, Cassian, and Sebastian. Once you enter the castle, you will interview 12 different castle members. After all the interviews are over, the voting process begins. After the first 2 voting processes *assuming you haven't gotten the killer yet*, you will be introduced to a game center and a store where you can purchase useful items. This game and store center will happen every intermission between the voting processes. There are riddles, questions and games. Please follow the directions later to play these. Although for the most part, all you need to enter is (a), (b), (c), (d), or a number. The goal of the game is to catch the killer as quick as you can, the longer it takes to find the killer, the more of a chance the killer finds you. Good luck in catching the killer!")

You must have killed the Queen there and hid the body somewhere. \n\nGardener: I was framed! I promise i have no idea how that got there!\n\nCassian: Then why did you say those bushes were untouched? When we checked they looked freshly trimmed? It seems like you were planning this. \n\nSebastian: Also, you werenâ€™t in your room the night before the Queen died? Explain that \n\nPriest: Yeah Ferdinand! (left a blank space for taylors version)\n\nGardener: Like I saidâ€¦ I was having an affair with the queen\n\nAnabel: Does that explain why the Queen turned to the left which led to the garden? After each confession, was she coming to see you? \n\nGardener: Yes. That is correct\n\nButler: Your affair does not explain why the window was broken next to the Garden though, can you explain that? Was the queen trying to escape when you were killing her! \n\nCassian: But there was no blood next to the window, even if the Gardener did clean up the blood it doesnâ€™t make sense why he would kill the Queen. Arenâ€™t they having an affair because they love each other? There's no reason why the Gardener would kill the Queen if he loved her. \n\nDoctor: The most logical conclusion we can come up with is that the Gardener tried to kill the queen inside the Garden storage room, but she escaped. He tried to chase after her and didnâ€™t notice she bled onto the bushes. When he finally caught up he murdered her and cleaned up the blood around the window. \n\nGame: Alright you cannot change your votes, the Gardener will be exiled regardless.\n\nGardener: No guys you have to believe me-\n\nGame: The Gardener has been voted outâ€¦")

However, there was also a lighter red shade next to the blood. \n\nJuliette: Doesnâ€™t that confirm it's the Gardner. We voted correctly right?
